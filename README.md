## Installation, Downloading & Updating

### Downloading:

You can always find the latest version by visiting the spigot page. This plugin works on all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers from version 1.13 and above.

### Installing:

When it comes to installing the plugin, Simply drop the JoinPrivileges-[version number].jar into your servers plugin folder and then start your server.

### Updating: 

Updating is very easy, all you're needing to do is download the new version of the plugin and replace the old version in your plugins folder.

I have implemented an Auto Config Updater that will automatically update all the files if I have changed them in any way.
